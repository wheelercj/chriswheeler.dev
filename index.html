    <p>Hi! I'm Chris Wheeler, a recent CSUN Computer Science grad and Computer Science tutor.</p>

    <p>I'm interested in many things including backend web, desktop, and systems development, language design, and
      teaching computer science. I've always wanted to be some kind of inventor; someone that makes things that are
      useful and make people happy. Now I'm finally able to do that by creating software and sharing what I've learned.
