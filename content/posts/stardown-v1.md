The first full version of [Stardown](https://github.com/wheelercj/Stardown) has been released! Stardown is a free browser extension I created for copying markdown links for websites. One click on its icon copies a markdown link for the current page. A double-click copies markdown links for all tabs. Right-clicking a website gives you a markdown link for where you right-clicked.

Although I have tons of bookmarks, I save even more website links into markdown files in Obsidian and notes about software I'm working on. I got tired of manually writing markdown links, and I wanted to learn about creating browser extensions anyways. After learning the basics, I searched for similar existing extensions but wasn't satisfied by any of them. They all required at least two clicks and had big menus with tons of options I didn't care about. None of them took advantage of [text fragments](https://web.dev/articles/text-fragments). That's why I decided to put a lot of effort into Stardown.

I use Stardown many times a day almost every day. I mostly use it to copy a link for only the current page for notes about useful/interesting websites, especially since I found browser history so difficult to search through that I don't use it. Occasionally, I copy links for all tabs when I want to temporarily close a bunch of related tabs to return to them later. Probably about a third of the time I copy text from a website, I also want a link to the site, so I select the text and use Stardown's right-click copy option to get everything at once.

Stardown is designed for all markdown editors and available for almost all major browsers. It's [open source](https://github.com/wheelercj/Stardown), easier to use than all similar extensions, and more likely to be up-to-date because of how simple it is and the fact that I use it all the time. I hope it will be helpful to you too.

P.S. â€” I published some notes on [making browser extensions](https://til.chriswheeler.dev/making-browser-extensions/).
